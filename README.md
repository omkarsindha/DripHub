# DripHub
I made this app using javaFx and connected it to database using JDBC, it also genrates pdf reciets using iText library.
To run the code
1) Add the 2 libraries in lib folder to to your project.
2) Make a SQL database named "drip_hub" import the drip_hub.sql file into the database
3) Run the runner file.
